## Git structure
Master is the version which is never broken and has good quality code. All code on master should be submitted via a pull request and have gone through peer code reviews when submitted to dev, integration testing on dev, and should be the final version of whatever feature you're working on.
Dev is our expected final version. All code on dev should be submitted via a pull request and be code reviewed before submitted. It should be the final version of whatever you're working on.
Feature branches can be made and deleted by the person who made it. Feature branches should be associated with an issue. If there isn't an issue already, create one and name the branch after it.
